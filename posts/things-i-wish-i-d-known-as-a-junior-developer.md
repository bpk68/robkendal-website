I've been a developer for over 15 years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.

I'm really _not_ that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.

So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.

It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning _how_ to learn.

Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.

_(Pssst -- If you like this article, come_ [_find me on Twitter_](https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode) _where I post regular helpful content every day)_

## Start writing a blog

This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently. 

Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned _as you're learning it_. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert. 

All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.

As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!

My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:

* [Should you start a blog as a developer](https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer "Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog")
* [How to start a blog](https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer "Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog") - a common question after 'what do I write about?'

## Ask more questions!

This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.

But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!). 

Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people. 

## Be honest on what you're passionate about

If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot. 

However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers. 

But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you _really_ enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this. 

For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured. 

This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.

The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.

With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you _don't_ want to know what _is_ right for you.

## Get a coding mentor

I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough. 

Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey. 

This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey. 

I'd recommend taking a look at [Coding Coach](https://codingcoach.io "Coding Coach website") or my very own [mentorship programmes](https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship "Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes") to find a mentor that's right for you.

## Mentor others

Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert. 

Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 _weeks_ into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out. 

That said, if you _are_ quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out. 

> Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started

It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.

## You don't get what you don't ask for

I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt. 

In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'. 

It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky. 

To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck. 

Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then _ask for it_!

Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them. 

The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.

## Keep track of all your wins

This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!

I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the [imposter syndrome](https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer "Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer") kicks in from time to time. 

It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come. 

## You don't have to know everything

## Senior doesn't mean encylopedia

## Titles don't really mean much in the long run

## Networking is essential!!

It really is _who you know_ not always _what you know_.

## Ignore the gatekeepers

## Recruiters are both the devil and angels in disguise

## Everyone feels like imposter
