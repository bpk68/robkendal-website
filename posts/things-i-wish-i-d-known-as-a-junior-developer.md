I've been a developer for over 15 years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code. 

I'm really _not_ that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project. 

So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft. 

It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning _how_ to learn.

Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.
