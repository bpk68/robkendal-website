In [part one of using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js](https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js), we looked at the basics of setting up a WordPress instance so that we can access Posts and Pages and custom content via GraphQL. We also created a new Next.js app using the `create-next-app` tool. 

For part two in the series, we're going to take those starting bases and connect the dots to supply content data from WordPress via the WPGraphQL plugin and access it in our Next.js project. 

## Cleaning up the new Next.js project

## Accessing external data in Next.js using `getStaticProps()`

## Listing blog posts from WordPress using GraphQL

## Handling dynamic routes like blog posts

Coming up next, in part three, we'll be creating an XML RSS feed as part of the deployment process so that we can publish and syndicate our posts across the web.
