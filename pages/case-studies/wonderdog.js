              <h1>Sneyd's Wonderdog</h1>
              <p>
                Sneydâ€™s is a family owned and operated company incorporating three generations of the same family and over 40 years experience in producing pet food products.
                They produce high quality pet food products priced well under the national average for equivalent feeds.

              <h2>The challenge</h2>
              <p>
                Sneyd's previous website had served them well, but they were struggling to gain ground against competitors across search rankings and were looking for a way to boost website sales.

              <p>
                I worked with Sneyd's to produce a brand new ecommerce website designed and built from the ground up on the robust combination of WordPress and Woocommerce.
              </p>
              <p>
                To address Sneyd's desire to rank higher across search engines, I helped with a range of SEO services, such as copy and content optimisation, landing pages, and SEO best-practices.
                This work delivered a <strong>65% boost in organic traffic</strong>, which helped power further sales.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website is very customer-centric, making it easy for visitors to find exactly what they're looking for via clear signaling, strong calls to action, and defined purchase pathways.
